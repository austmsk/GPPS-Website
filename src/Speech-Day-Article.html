          Speech Day of 2024 at Genesis Preparatory Primary School (GPPS) was a vibrant and memorable event. The day kicked off with a lively match through Sanje and neighboring townships, featuring the school band, teachers, students in their finest uniforms, and top-class graduates donning colorful gowns and headgear. Spectators lined the streets to cheer on the GPPS young stars.

          Following the match, a holy mass was held at the school, led by Rev. Fr. Ssekatawa Alex, who also serves as the chairman of the board of governors. The mass was a beautiful way to bring the community together.

          The speeches and project showcases that followed were impressive. Head Prefect Ddumba Joel warmly welcomed visiting parents and dignitaries. The learners of P.1 and P.2 engaged in a thought-provoking debate on the motion "private schools are better than government schools," with the proponents emerging victorious. The debate likely touched on points such as the quality of education, facilities, and extracurricular opportunities.

          Other highlights included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dehydration Skit</strong>: Learners of P.4 and P.5 performed an informative skit about dehydration and its management.</li>
          <li><strong>Fainting Skit</strong>: Learners of P.5 and P.6 performed a skit about fainting, likely covering its causes, symptoms, and first aid response.</li>
          <li><strong>Ballet Dance</strong>: The Baby class delighted the audience with a beautiful ballet dance.</li>
          <li><strong>News Bulletin</strong>: P.5 and P.6 students presented the GPPS news bulletin in both English and Luganda.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The day concluded with a special meal for parents, an opportunity to meet with teachers, and the distribution of academic reports. The top-class graduates were awarded their certificates, marking a significant milestone in their academic journey.

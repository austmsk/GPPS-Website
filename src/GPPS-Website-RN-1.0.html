        Looking ahead, we are planning to introduce a "Contact Us" page that will allow users to reach out to us directly through the website. This page will be connected to a database to store and manage user inquiries efficiently. We are currently evaluating several database providers to ensure the best performance and reliability. The companies under consideration include MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. Each of these options offers unique advantages, and we are committed to selecting the one that best meets our needs.
